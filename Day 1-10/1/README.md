# Day 1:

## Data Engineering Fundamentals

* The fundamentals of data engineering involve the design, construction, and maintenance of data pipelines and infrastructure to support data-driven applications and systems. Data engineers work with data scientists, analysts, and other stakeholders to understand their data needs and develop solutions to meet those needs.

Some key concepts in data engineering include:

    * Data ingestion: This involves extracting data from various sources, such as databases, files, or APIs.

    * Data transformation: This involves cleaning, filtering, and transforming the data to make it ready for analysis or storage.

    * Data storage: This involves storing the data in an appropriate location, such as a database or file storage system.

    * Data access: This involves making the data available to users, such as data scientists or analysts, through interfaces or APIs.

Data engineers use a variety of tools and technologies to design, build, and maintain data pipelines and infrastructure. These may include programming languages such as Python and SQL, big data frameworks such as Hadoop and Spark, data storage technologies such as relational databases and NoSQL databases, and cloud computing platforms such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

Some common workflows and processes in data engineering include:

    * Designing and building data pipelines to extract, transform, and load data from various sources.

    * Storing and organizing data in appropriate locations, such as databases or file storage systems.

    * Making data available to users through interfaces or APIs.

    * Monitoring and maintaining data pipelines and infrastructure to ensure their reliability and performance.

    * Data integration and ETL (extract, transform, load) tools: Data engineers may use tools such as Talend, Apache Nifi, and Apache Beam to build and maintain data pipelines.

    * Data orchestration and scheduling tools: Data engineers may use tools such as Apache Airflow and Luigi to schedule and automate data pipelines.

    * Data version control and collaboration tools: Data engineers may use tools such as Git and GitHub to collaborate on data projects and track changes to data pipelines.

## Workflows or common process involved in Data Engineering
There are several common workflows and processes involved in data engineering. These may include:

    * Data ingestion: This involves extracting data from various sources, such as databases, files, or APIs. Data engineers may use tools such as SQL, Python, and API connectors to extract data from these sources.

    * Data transformation: This involves cleaning, filtering, and transforming the data to make it ready for analysis or storage. Data engineers may use tools such as Python, SQL, and big data frameworks such as Hadoop and Spark to transform data.

    * Data storage: This involves storing the data in an appropriate location, such as a database or file storage system. Data engineers may use tools such as SQL, Python, and data storage technologies such as relational databases and NoSQL databases to store data.

    * Data access: This involves making the data available to users, such as data scientists or analysts, through interfaces or APIs. Data engineers may use tools such as SQL, Python, and API connectors to make data available to users.

    * Data pipeline design and development: Data engineers may use tools such as Python, SQL, and data integration and ETL (extract, transform, load) tools such as Talend and Apache Nifi to design and build data pipelines.

    * Data pipeline testing and quality assurance: Data engineers may use tools such as Python, SQL, and data management and governance tools such as Talend and Apache Nifi to test and ensure the quality of data pipelines.

    * Data pipeline monitoring and maintenance: Data engineers may use tools such as Python, SQL, and data orchestration and scheduling tools such as Apache Airflow and Luigi to monitor and maintain data pipelines.

    * Data version control and collaboration: Data engineers may use tools such as Git and GitHub to collaborate on data projects and track changes to data pipelines.

## Data Storage

There are several options for storing data, including:

    * Relational databases: Relational databases are structured databases that store data in tables with rows and columns. Each row represents a record, and each column represents a field. Relational databases use SQL (Structured Query Language) to manipulate and query data. Examples of relational databases include MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL.

    * NoSQL databases: NoSQL databases are non-relational databases that do not use SQL to manipulate and query data. Instead, they use different data models and query languages to store and retrieve data. Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, and Couchbase.

* File storage systems: File storage systems are used to store and organize files. They may be used to store structured data, such as CSV or Excel files, or unstructured data, such as images or documents. Examples of file storage systems include local file systems, network-attached storage (NAS), and cloud storage systems such as AWS S3 and Google Cloud Storage.

When choosing a data storage option, it's important to consider factors such as the size and structure of the data, the performance and scalability requirements, and the cost. Relational databases are well-suited for storing structured data with well-defined relationships, while NoSQL databases are better for storing unstructured data or data with flexible schemas. File storage systems are often used for storing large volumes of unstructured data.
