## Data Engineer Definition
A Data Engineer is a role within a company whose responsibility is to pull data in
from various data sources and work with the data in a way that produces business
value by building and maintaining data processing pipelines.

## What is Data?

Data is a collection of facts, figures, and other information that can be processed and analyzed to extract insights and knowledge. Data can be quantitative (numerical) or qualitative (non-numerical). It can be structured (organized into a specific format, such as rows and columns in a spreadsheet) or unstructured (not organized into a specific format).

Data can be generated from various sources, including sensors, instruments, experiments, observations, transactions, and interactions. It can be used to answer questions, make decisions, and solve problems in a wide range of fields, including science, business, healthcare, education, and government.

There are many types of data, including demographic data (e.g. age, gender, income), transactional data (e.g. purchases, payments), behavioral data (e.g. clicks, searches), and sensor data (e.g. temperature, humidity). The value of data lies in its ability to provide insights and inform decision-making.

Data is often collected, stored, and analyzed using specialized tools and technologies, such as databases, data warehouses, and analytics software. The field of data science is focused on using data to extract insights and knowledge, while the field of data engineering is focused on the design, construction, and maintenance of the systems and infrastructure that support the collection, storage, and analysis of data.

## Genral data sources:
Data can be generated from a wide variety of sources. Some common sources of data include:

1. Transactions: Data can be generated from transactions, such as purchases, payments, or financial transactions. This type of data can be used to understand consumer behavior, track revenue and expenses, and identify trends and patterns.

2. Sensors: Data can be generated from sensors, such as those found in smart devices, wearables, or industrial equipment. This type of data can be used to track and monitor various types of information, such as temperature, humidity, location, or movement.

3. Experiments: Data can be generated from experiments, such as scientific experiments, clinical trials, or market research studies. This type of data can be used to test hypotheses, validate theories, and identify trends and patterns.

4. Observations: Data can be generated from observations, such as surveys, focus groups, or customer feedback. This type of data can be used to understand attitudes, opinions, and preferences.

5. Interactions: Data can be generated from interactions, such as social media posts, online searches, or website visits. This type of data can be used to understand consumer behavior, track trends and patterns, and identify opportunities for improvement.

6. Public datasets: Data can also be obtained from public sources, such as government agencies, research organizations, or non-profit organizations. This type of data can be used for research, analysis, and other purposes.

Overall, data can be generated from a wide range of sources and can be used to answer questions, make decisions, and solve problems in a wide variety of fields.


## Value to Business

There are many ways that data can be used to add value to a business. Here are a few examples of how data can be used to add value using employee and sales data:

1. Improving employee productivity: By analyzing employee data, such as time spent on tasks, project completion rates, and engagement levels, a business can identify areas for improvement and implement strategies to increase productivity. For example, a business might use data to identify bottlenecks in workflow and implement process improvements to streamline workflows.

2. Optimizing sales and marketing efforts: By analyzing sales data, such as customer demographics, purchasing patterns, and marketing campaign results, a business can identify opportunities to optimize its sales and marketing efforts. For example, a business might use data to segment its customer base and develop targeted marketing campaigns or to optimize its pricing strategy.

3. Identifying new business opportunities: By analyzing data from a variety of sources, a business can identify new opportunities for growth and expansion. For example, a business might use data to identify untapped markets or to identify trends in customer behavior that could inform new product or service offerings.

4. Improving customer service: By analyzing data from customer interactions, such as call center logs, social media posts, and online reviews, a business can identify opportunities to improve customer service and satisfaction. For example, a business might use data to identify common customer complaints and implement strategies to address those issues.

Overall, using data to add value to a business involves using data to inform decision-making and drive business objectives. By analyzing data from various sources, businesses can identify trends, patterns, and opportunities that can inform strategies and actions to improve efficiency, optimize operations, and drive growth.
