# Data-Engnieering
Data Engineering study plan for Day 1 to 10.

## [Day 1](https://github.com/Gowtham-Kanagaraj/Data-Engnieering/tree/main/Day%201-10/1):
* Begin by learning the fundamentals of data engineering, including the role of a data engineer, the tools and technologies used in the field, and the common workflows and processes involved.

* Familiarize yourself with SQL and practice writing basic queries to extract and manipulate data from databases.

* Learn about data storage options, including relational databases, NoSQL databases, and file storage systems.

* This first day of the study plan is focused on introducing you to the basics of data engineering and getting you familiar with some of the tools and technologies used in the field. By the end of the day, you should have a good understanding of the role of a data engineer and be able to write basic SQL queries. You should also have an overview of the different options for storing data, including relational databases, NoSQL databases, and file storage systems.

## [Day 2](https://github.com/Gowtham-Kanagaraj/Data-Engnieering/tree/main/Day%201-10/2):
* Review the key concepts in data engineering that you learned on Day 1.

* Make sure you understand the main tasks and responsibilities of a data engineer, as well as the tools and technologies they use.

* Begin learning about data modeling and design.
* Learn about some common data storage technologies used by data engineers. This could include relational databases (e.g. MySQL, Oracle), NoSQL databases (e.g. MongoDB, Cassandra), and file storage systems (e.g. HDFS, S3). Understand the differences between these technologies and when it is appropriate to use each one.

* Continue learning SQL and practice writing more advanced queries. This could include learning about different data types, functions, and operators
